  <p>At 1DES, we rely on Comet as a powerful platform for tracking, visualizing, and understanding our machine learning experiments. With its user-friendly interface and collaborative tools, Comet has become an essential part of our workflow for building, refining, and explaining ML models.</p>

  <p>Visualizing Model Predictions and Architecture</p>

  <p>Comet helps us track and visualize model predictions with clarity. By exploring the model architecture visually, we can spot potential design issues, validate assumptions, and fine-tune the structure for better results. These visual diagnostics accelerate our experimentation cycle and help ensure each model iteration is grounded in evidence.</p>

  <p>Understanding Performance with Confusion Matrices and Reports</p>

  <p>For classification tasks, Comet enables us to generate <strong>confusion matrices</strong>—a simple yet powerful way to compare predicted versus actual outcomes. These matrices, paired with detailed <strong>classification reports</strong>, help us assess the performance of each class and guide our next steps for model tuning.</p>

  <p>Exploring High-Dimensional Data with t-SNE and UMAP</p>

  <p>High-dimensional data can be difficult to interpret. Comet supports advanced embedding techniques such as <strong>t-SNE</strong> and <strong>UMAP</strong> to reduce dimensionality while preserving structure. These visualizations allow us to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Explore data point relationships</li>
    <li>Identify natural clusters</li>
    <li>Reveal underlying patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Their interactive nature deepens our understanding of the data landscape and uncovers insights that aren’t always visible through raw metrics.</p>
