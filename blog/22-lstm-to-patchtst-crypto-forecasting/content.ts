    At <strong>1DES</strong>, time-series forecasting is a critical component of how we build intelligence into our trading automation systems ‚Äî especially for fast-moving markets like <strong>BTCUSDT</strong>. Our current models are primarily based on <strong>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</strong> networks, and they‚Äôve delivered stable results over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, recent advancements in deep learning ‚Äî particularly <strong>Transformer</strong> architectures ‚Äî have opened the door to new possibilities. In this two-part series, we‚Äôll explore what makes Transformers powerful for time-series tasks and why we‚Äôre planning to experiment with a specific variant: <strong>PatchTST</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This first part is all about theory: what Transformers are, how attention works, and why PatchTST stands out among the crowd. In the second part, we‚Äôll build, benchmark, and compare PatchTST to our existing LSTM setup.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold">üîç What Are Transformers?</h2>

  <p>
    Transformers are deep learning architectures originally developed for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Introduced in the 2017 paper <em>‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù</em>, Transformers replaced the need for recurrent neural networks (like LSTM) by introducing a new mechanism: <strong>self-attention</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike RNNs that process data step-by-step, Transformers take in an entire sequence at once. Each time step in the input can attend (or ‚Äúlook at‚Äù) all others in the sequence. This massively parallel structure allows Transformers to:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
    <li>Model long-range dependencies</li>
    <li>Learn global structure in the data</li>
    <li>Train significantly faster than RNN-based models</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Transformers have revolutionized NLP, powering models like BERT and GPT. More recently, the same ideas have been adapted for <strong>time-series forecasting</strong>.
  </p>

  <hr class="my-10 border-gray-700" />

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold">üß† What Is Attention (and Self-Attention)?</h2>

  <p>
    The core idea behind attention is <strong>contextual weighting</strong>. In <strong>self-attention</strong>, every point in the sequence decides how much attention to pay to every other point.
  </p>

  <div class="rounded-lg border border-gray-700 bg-gray-900 p-4 text-sm">
    <p class="m-0">
      <strong>Example:</strong> If you're forecasting BTCUSDT and see a price spike, a self-attention model can learn that a similar spike a few hours ago may be relevant. It doesn‚Äôt have to wait step-by-step to reach that point ‚Äî it connects the dots directly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="mt-4">Attention helps the model:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
    <li>Recognize repeating patterns even when far apart</li>
    <li>Understand feature interactions (e.g., price + volume + indicators)</li>
    <li>Assign more weight to important historical windows</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This mechanism is the backbone of all Transformer-based models.</p>

  <h3 class="text-base sm:text-lg font-semibold">PatchTST</h3>
  <p class="mt-1 text-sm sm:text-base">
    Inspired by Vision Transformers, it divides a time-series into <strong>patches</strong> (small blocks of time), processes them in parallel, and applies self-attention over patch representations.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold">üöÄ Why We‚Äôre Trying PatchTST</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>PatchTST</strong> has shown state-of-the-art performance across several public time-series forecasting benchmarks. It offers:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
    <li>Great performance on multivariate data like OHLCV + indicators</li>
    <li>Fast training and inference due to patch-based representation</li>
    <li>The ability to detect both local structures (short-term signals) and global dependencies (macro trends)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Given its success in research and practical relevance to financial data, we‚Äôre going to put it to the test.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the next post, we‚Äôll implement <strong>PatchTST</strong> using TensorFlow/Keras, run benchmarks against our current LSTM-based models, and share performance insights.
